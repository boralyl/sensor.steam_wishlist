## Displaying in Lovelace

You are able to use any Home Assistant card to display a list of your games that are on sale by utilizing the `sensor.steam_wishlist` sensor. Below, are 2 cards that fully support this integration and its sensor attributes:

### I. upcoming-media-card

You can use [upcoming-media-card](https://github.com/custom-cards/upcoming-media-card) to display your Steam wishlist items that are on sale. You can also toggle displaying your non-sale wishlist items via the YAML setting `collapse: price=ðŸŽ«` _(along with enabling the **Options** integration setting)_ like so:

Example YAML:

```yaml
- type: custom:upcoming-media-card
  entity: sensor.steam_wishlist_978793482343112
  title: Steam Wishlist
  image_style: fanart
  collapse: price=ðŸŽ«
  max: 10
```
